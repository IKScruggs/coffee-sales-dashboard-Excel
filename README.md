# Coffee Sales Dashboard
Develop an Excel dashboard to analyze coffee sales data across three countries. The project will involve evaluating sales, customer demographics, and product performance using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and pivot charts. The goal is to create a dynamic, interactive dashboard for better decision-making.

# 1. Gather and Organize Data
**•	Action:** Collect coffee sales, customer, and product data. (Github)

**•	Tasks:**

o	Verify data formats (dates, currencies, etc.).

o	Ensure data is clean and complete (no duplicates, missing values, etc.).  Some values were missing; however, those missing values did not impact the analysis of the data.  

o	Organize data into appropriate Excel tables for easy analysis.

# 2. Data Preparation

•	**Action:** Prepare the data for analysis.

•	**Tasks:**

o	Duplicated the orders tab to preserve the original data.  Named the duplicate worksheet tables to use as a  working table for analysis.  

o	Filled missing data in the tables tab by using XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH formulas for data that appeared in the customer and products tabs.

o	Calculated sales column.

o	Added Coffee Type Name and Roast Type Name Column so full name of product and roast types would appear on the dashboard.

o	Added and populated Loyalty Card information using XLOOKUP.

o	Converted data types into proper format for easy of use in the dashboard.

# 3. Set Up Pivot Tables

**•	Action:** Create pivot tables to summarize the data.

**•	Tasks:**

o	Build pivot tables for key metrics like total sales over time, sales by country and top customer segments.

o	Filter pivot tables by country, product, and time period.

o	Include relevant data points such as sales volume, average sale price, and product popularity.

# 4. Create Pivot Charts

**•	Action:** Visualize data with pivot charts.

**•	Tasks:**

o	Create charts for each key metric (e.g., total sales over time, sales by country and top customer segments) using slicers to allow drilling down.

o	Ensure charts are dynamic and linked to pivot tables for real-time updates.

o	Customize the chart format (titles, labels, color schemes).

# 5. Build the Dashboard

**•	Action:** Design a dynamic dashboard using the pivot tables and charts.

**•	Tasks:**

o	Arrange charts and pivot tables into a clear, user-friendly layout.

o	Add slicers or filters to allow easy navigation between different data views (country, product, date ranges).

o	Ensure the dashboard is responsive and visually appealing.

# 6. Test and Refine

**•	Action:** Review and refine the dashboard.

**•	Tasks:**

o	Test the dashboard with sample data to ensure all calculations and visualizations work correctly.

o	Dashboard is ready for external review and refinement to meet the end user’s needs.  

o	Adjust formatting and usability based on feedback.

o	Verify the accuracy of the data and insights generated.

# 7. Documentation and Handover

**•	Action:** Provide documentation for users and hand over the final dashboard.

**•	Tasks:**

o	Create a guide on how to use the dashboard (e.g., how to apply filters and interpret charts).

o	Document key metrics, formulas, and any assumptions made during the project.

o	Provide the final dashboard to the stakeholders for review and use.
